# MeetingBuddy hack for Startup Hack
### a Pajtek production

It was super-fun building this during #startuphack here in Gothenburg. There's database calls in the views, non-restful APIs and, of course, zero tests. It was awesome!

We won zero things and we did not pitch. Turns out we're not very good marketers, but after 10 hours, we're pretty happy with ourselves.
